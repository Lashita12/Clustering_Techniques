# Clustering_Techniques
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their annual income and spending scores using clustering techniques. K-means and agglomerative clustering are applied to identify different customer segments. The elbow method and silhouette score are used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the results are visualized to show the clustered data.

Libraries Used:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical computing.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.

Scikit-Learn: Machine learning, specifically clustering algorithms and performance metrics.
